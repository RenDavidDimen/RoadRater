# Road Rater

The application that allows users to rate the paving conditions of the roads they drive on!

## Workflow

This application will be following the [GitFlow] branching model.

This ensures that versioning the code is comprehensive and maintainable.

## Implementation

- **Sort Features**:        Quick Sort implemented on an array of Roads to sort by name
- **Search Features**:      Binary Search implemented on a sorted array of Roads
- **Shortest Path Search**: Dijkstra's Algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path and smoothest path from one point to another
- **Google Maps API**:      Requested a JSON response from the Google Maps API using a URL. Paresed the response to receive the routes and possible alternate routes, the name of the streets traversed, and the distance traveled on those roads.


### Branch Breakdown

- **master**:   Will contain working versions of the application.
- **dev**:      This is where most of the conflicts will need to be resolved and pull requests merged to the branch.
- **Name**:     Your name will act as a placeholder so we know who is working on what feature.
- **Features**: The title "Features" may be replaced with a more descriptive name of what is being worked on. (ex, sorting).
