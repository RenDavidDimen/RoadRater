# Road Rater

The application that allows users to rate the paving conditions of the roads they drive on!

## Workflow

This application will be following the [GitFlow] branching model.

This ensures that versioning the code is comprehensive and maintainable.

## Implementation

- **Quick Sort**: Sorting method implemented on an array of Roads to sort by name
- **Binary Search**: Search implemented on a sorted array of Roads to find them by name
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Algorithm implemented to find the shortest path and smoothest path from one point to another
- **Google Maps API**: Requested a JSON response from the Google Maps API using a URL. Paresed the response to receive the routes and possible alternate routes, the name of the streets traversed, and the distance traveled on those roads.


### Branch Breakdown

- **master**:   Will contain working versions of the application.
- **dev**:      This is where most of the conflicts will need to be resolved and pull requests merged to the branch.
