# Road Rater

The application that allows users to rate the paving conditions of the roads they drive on!

## Workflow

This application will be following the GitFlow[1] branching model.

This ensures that versioning the code is comprehensive and maintainable.

### Branch Breakdown

- **master**:   Will contain working versions of the application.
- **dev**:      This is where most of the conflicts will need to be resolved and pull requests merged to the branch.
- **Name**:     Your name will act as a placeholder so we know who is working on what feature.
- **Features**: The title "Features" may be replaced with a more descriptive name of what is being worked on. (ex, sorting).

master
> dev
>> Ren-David/		
>>> Features

>>Megan/

>>Yang/
